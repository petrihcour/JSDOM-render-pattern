# JSDOM-render-pattern
You are helping your local bookstore build a shopping cart for their website. The list of books, prices, and quantities are stored in an array named books. For this challenge, you will create a few helper functions to display the cart, sort the books, and make small modifications to the cart.

The design of the website is not important for this assessment. The capability of using `render()` to display the necessary data on the webpage and correctly sort the prices by ascending to descending order is the goal.
